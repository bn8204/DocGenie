All software products with simple or complex needs should be accompanied by technical documentation to help stakeholders and developers understand the software development. It does not end there – it also requires product documentation and user manuals for the benefit of customer onboarding and using the product.

Without technical documentation, developers and customers are in the dark about the purpose of your software. It becomes hard to troubleshoot issues and ensure the software is working properly.

Technical documentation is a vital aspect of working software, 
and should not be skipped during the release cycle.
Whether it’s release notes, knowledge bases, or user manuals, remember that 51% 
of customers want to see a FAQs section on a website when making an online purchase.

“Docs or it didn’t happen” is a mantra for anyone building a software product,
and means that documentation is more than a byproduct or afterthought of your project. It closes the gap between development and software users, as well as the gaps between those who are involved in building the software.

**What is technical documentation?**
Technical documentation describes and explains anything to do with your software product, ranging from internal documentation for teams to external documentation written for end users. It encompasses all written documents relating to software product development and many different types are created throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

It describes the features and functionality of the product clearly so that anyone can use it. The primary goal is to explain a particular aspect of the product to the target audience. Although it comes in a number of different forms, most technical documentation is published online and it’s normally written by technical writers, developers and project managers.

Technical documentation should be clear, concise, and accurate, and actually, solve a problem for your users.

**Importance of technical documentation**
Technical documentation is vitally important for your software company. Here are some reasons why.

Enables quick decision-making by the product team
When your product team has access to the right technical documentation, they can make much quicker decisions. They don’t have to scroll back through emails or threads in collaboration tools – they can instead instantly consult the documents produced alongside the software that explains how everything works and records the reasoning behind the decisions.

**Contextual help for users**

When customers are using their software they can access your technical documentation alongside the product for help in using the tool. Documentation can be displayed in-app so customers don’t have to switch contexts when they run into issues. This improves the overall usability and experience of your software product.
Marketing tool

Having robust technical documentation makes it easier to advertise your product to potential customers. Many customers will be researching in more detail how your product works and technical documentation can explain your software features in more depth than you can get with typical marketing materials.

**Reduces tech support calls**
When you have comprehensive technical documentation,
customers can consult the docs when they run into technical issues. 
This reduces the number of inbound calls you get to your tech support line and means you can support more customers on a smaller budget. Most customers prefer to troubleshoot problems themselves instead of waiting around for a person to help them.
