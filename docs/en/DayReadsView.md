Documentation is an important form of communication – your stakeholders
and developers don’t need to talk to each other directly to access information about 
the software. Your documentation saves knowledge for posterity and enables
your team to look back at work that has previously been completed 
in order to inform their future decisions.

**What is Technical Documentation Software?**

Technical documentation software allows you to create content for your users. 
It’s typically for an application, product or system. The documentation 
software allows you to host your content in a self-service knowledge base.
Users can access content through search and categories.

Technical documentation for software includes how-to guides, tutorials,
technical reference and explanation. It’s often written by technical
writers. It can also be authored by developers, support agents, and more.

Technical documentation software allows you to scale your customer support
– without increasing costs. You can create and publish content that solves
customer problems, without the need to open a ticket. 

Writing technical documentation is no easy task. Artificial Intelligence features in the software make this process a whole lot easier. Automatically generating article titles and descriptions optimized for SEO is just one job they can do. 63% of businesses
are already using some form of AI-powered customer self-service.

**Deflects More Customer Tickets**
73% of customers desire the ability to handle issues independently. 
When you have documentation to offer your customers you can deflect more
tickets.

 
**Improves the Product Experience**
Customers who can learn how to use your product using documentation will
have a better product experience, which leads to increased customer retention 
and loyalty.

 
**Cuts the Costs of Customer Support**
Agents’ time costs money, while the initial investment in technical documentation
pays off in the long run. Thus, the fewer tickets agents need to handle, 
the more money you save.
