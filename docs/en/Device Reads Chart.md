**Object Oriented Programming in Java with Examples**


This page contains a list of articles, tutorials, and examples on important
OOPS concepts and OOPS principles.

Well, in order to design strong object-oriented design for Java or JavaEE 
Web Applications, you need to have strong knowledge of OOPS concepts and 
OOPS principles.

All OOPS concepts and OOPS principles are explained with real-world examples,
lots of source code with an explanation, applicability, class diagrams, etc.

**OOPS Concepts** 
In this section of the tutorials, we cover basic and advanced OOPS concepts for beginners: 
- Object 
- Class 
- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism 
- Composition 
- Aggregation 
- Association 
- Cohesion 
- Coupling 
- Delegation

An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity or concept. It is created based on the blueprint provided by the class and has its own identity, state, and behavior.

- Identity: Each object has a unique identity, which differentiates it from other objects.
- State: The state of an object is represented by its attributes (fields or properties).
- Behavior: The behavior of an object is represented by its methods (functions or operations).

**Key Points:**
Objects are instances of classes.
They encapsulate state and behavior.
Objects are created using the new keyword in Java.
Syntax for Creating an Object
The syntax for creating an object in Java is:

{ ClassName objectName = new ClassName(); }
