Documentation comes in many forms, ranging from product documentation, software documentation, process documentation, academic guides, user manual, guides, SME documentation, instructional manual, release notes, and more.

But regardless of the technical documentation or format being used for multi-channel publishing purposes, the goal for all writers when writing documentation is to provide an end-user or the intended audience with the technical specification they need to get to the right answer or solution. A comprehensive documentation site (or knowledge base) not only offers valuable content; it also has an impact on how users experience and interact with your product and brand.

What are Good Documentation Practices?
When it comes to creating a great documentation site and knowing how to write technical documentation, there are a couple of best practices to keep in mind:

Comprehensive. Comprehensive documentation covers all aspects of the product, without making assumptions about what the user may or may not know. Examples, code samples, images, videos, and other content can play a role in providing a seamless experience for users in your user documentation.
Up-to-date. Nothing is more frustrating to an end user than locating an online help topic or support page, only to find that it references an outdated feature or version of a product in your technical documents..
Easy to Find. Users shouldn’t have to hunt through your site to find the answer. A menu, robust search functionality, related content links, or other easy navigation elements make for a better user interface that makes it easier for users to discover content.
Visual Appeal. A well-designed knowledge base goes a long way in keeping the end user engaged with your content on your site for effective technical communication. By offering an inviting, clear experience that looks great on both mobile and desktop devices, users are given a consistent look-and-feel that matches your brand instead of ordinary technical writing text across a corpus of dull, lengthy technical documents.
